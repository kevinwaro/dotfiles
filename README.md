kevinwaro  dotfiles
===================

My personal configuration files, to make me more productive
(or to waste more time in dotfiles tweaking).


Requirements
------------

To use those configuration files, you will need:

* bash as your default shell
* vim 

vim Configurations
------------------

Some classical configurations mainly based on the user interface, 
colors and fonts, tab and indent settings, the status line, and
some useful mappings.

I'm using many useful plugins as: 
* . **pathogen:** > Poor man's package manager (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* . **airline:** > Lean & mean status/tabline for vim (https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
* . **syntastic:** > A syntax checking plugin -https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)

And the solarized colorscheme (http://ethanschoover.com/solarized)

bashrc Configurations
---------------------

I customized the prompt to have some visuals warnings concerning the 
usage of cpu, the user, the session and the disk usage. 

I also added my personal functions and aliases and enabled the programmable 
completion.
